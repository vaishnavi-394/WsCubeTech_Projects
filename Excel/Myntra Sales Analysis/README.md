## 📋 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing **Myntra’s sales dataset** using **Advanced Excel** and **Power Query**.
The goal was to clean, transform, and analyze raw data to uncover patterns in **discounts, prices, and product categories**, preparing the dataset for further analytics or dashboard use.

## 🎯 **Objectives**

✅ Clean and standardize the Myntra dataset using **Power Query Editor**
✅ Handle missing values in `DiscountPrice` and `DiscountOffer`
✅ Convert inconsistent offers (like “50% OFF”, “Rs.200 OFF”) into a single standardized format
✅ Apply **advanced Excel functions** for conditional analysis
✅ Derive category-wise insights to support better pricing and discount decisions

## 🧮 **Sample Formulas**

### 🔹 Standardize Discount Offer

```excel
=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("Rs.",[@DiscountOffer])),
   [@DiscountOffer],
   "Rs. " & ROUND((VALUE(SUBSTITUTE([@DiscountOffer],"%",""))/100)*[@[OriginalPrice (in Rs)]],0)
)
```

### 🔹 Identify Missing Discounts

```excel
=IF(AND(ISBLANK([@[DiscountPrice (in Rs)]]),ISBLANK([@DiscountOffer])),"Missing","Available")
```

### 🔹 Fill Missing Discount Prices with Category Average

```excel
=IF(
   OR(ISBLANK([@[DiscountPrice (in Rs)]]),[@[DiscountPrice (in Rs)]]=0),
   AVERAGEIFS([DiscountPrice (in Rs)],[Category],[@Category]),
   [@[DiscountPrice (in Rs)]]
)
```

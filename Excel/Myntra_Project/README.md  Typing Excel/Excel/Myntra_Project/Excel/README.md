Welcome to the Excel Projects section of my Data Analytics learning journey!
As an aspiring Data Analyst, Iâ€™m building a strong foundation in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Microsoft Excel â€” one of the most essential tools for any analyst.

Each project in this folder demonstrates practical, real-world use cases where Excel is used to:

Present key findings visually and effectively

ðŸ§  Key Learning Areas

Data Analysis using functions like VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, and logical formulas

Visualization through Pivot Charts and Conditional Formatting

Dashboard Creation for storytelling and performance tracking

Business Insights through KPI calculation and trend analysis

ðŸ’¡ Goal

To strengthen my ability to analyze business data and communicate insights effectively using Excel before advancing to tools like Power BI and Python.
